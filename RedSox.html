The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Red Sox compete in MLB as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. The Red Sox have won eight World Series championships and have played in 12. Founded in 1901 as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912. The Red Sox are consistently one of the top MLB teams in average road attendance, while the small capacity of Fenway Park prevents them from leading in overall attendance.
